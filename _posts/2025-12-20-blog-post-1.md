My first Python project had magic numbers everywhere. alpha=2.0 here, alpha=0.15 there... When I needed to change something, it was a nightmare. I had to find where the parameters are located. Sometimes I lost track of them and found inconsistency across the scripts which resulted in breaking the scripts.

A config file, short for "configuration file", is a file comprised of all the parameter settings used in the scripts. Instead of scattered approach, I put them in one place. It's helpful because...
- Easy to update
- Prevents errors
- Makes sharing easier

My sample config file looks like this:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict

# Common imports used across all scripts
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# ----------------------------
# GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
# ----------------------------
@dataclass
class GlobalConfig:
    """
    Central configuration for the entire forecasting system.
    All scripts import this to ensure consistency.
    """
    
    # =================================================================
    # BASE DIRECTORIES
    # =================================================================
    project_root: Path = Path(__file__).parent
    data_dir: Path = project_root / "data"
    out_dir: Path = project_root / "output"  
```

### Dataclasses decorator
